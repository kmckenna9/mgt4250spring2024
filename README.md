# MGT4250 Spring 2024 Course Project
Author: Kailey McKenna, kmckenna9@elon.edu
## Project Description
This repository is for the course project of MGT 4250 at Elon University. The purpose of this project was to provide questions and analytical insights to data of our choosing. I chose to look into the MLB franchise and specifically into the Boston Red Sox.
### Questions of interest
- Question 1 : What ballpark location in the MLB East division has had the largest amounts of total home wins? 
- Question 2 :  How does game attendance affect the Red Sox’s success on the field?
- Question 3: Is there a relationship between walks scored and homeruns scored within Eastern division teams?
### Importance
- This is *especially* **important** because...
 1. Reason: Marketing efforts by MLB teams can be increased geographically through billboards, radio shows, or local grocery stores once analysts know which ballpark locations are bringing in the most and least number of fans.
 2. Reason: Having this information about how attendance affects team success, Red Sox marketers specifically can focus on increasing their efforts for big games in order to increase the odds of winning.
 3. Reason: Seeing how walks correlates to homeruns can help The Red Sox's coaches and players increase their odds of winning with a different approach to the game.

## My Tableau Workbook

## Interpreting Visualizations
## Visualization 1
![Sheet 1](https://github.com/kmckenna9/mgt4250spring2024/assets/169082902/6116656d-ee16-4424-b048-599374f2e316)
My first visualization compared Eastern division ballparks and their sum of home attendance compared to their sum of wins. There was a clear correlation between the sum of wins and sum of home attendance therefore indicating a relationship between the two. Fenway Park had the highest home attendance and sum of wins in the eastern division. I colored the sum of wins with a sequential color map to show the descending pattern of the eastern division teams as their sum of home attendence decended accordingly. A large takeaway from this visualization is that there is a strong correlation between eastern division teams sum of wins compared to their sum home attendence, therefore answering Question 1 and partially answering Question 2. 
## Visualization 2
![Sheet 2](https://github.com/kmckenna9/mgt4250spring2024/assets/169082902/7e5e8e34-973f-49fd-94df-c1a5a2338d7e)
My second visualization is a series of three seperate line charts filtered specifically to the Boston Red Sox in attempt to expand my findings from the first visualization. I wanted to specifically look at how their average home attendence compared to average amounts of wins and homeruns over the past twenty years (2000-2020). Because measures like homeruns and wins are largely attributed to a teams succcess, I thought it would be interesting to compare these lines to their average home attendence after the correlation we found in the first visualization. As we can see, the lines all follow a very similar path, almost mirroring each other at points. Knowing this information, I will be able to compare the years of the highest homerun and win averages to the years of the highest home attendance to see how game attendance affects the Red Sox’s success, and moving forward how the franchise can capitalize on that financially.  
## Visualization 3
![Sheet 3](https://github.com/kmckenna9/mgt4250spring2024/assets/169082902/cf0d8666-58c0-4d97-8265-0652433315f2)
My third visualization looks at the eastern division, specifically over the last 10 years. I wanted to see how the Red Sox compared to the other eastern division teams based on their sum of walks and sum of homeruns from 2010-2020. There is a strong positive correlation between the sum of walks and homeruns teams in this division were scoring indicating a relationship between the two. Given this information, we can begin to draw conclusions for example how scoring more walks in a game can lead to scoring more homeruns. Going forward, the Red Sox can take this into account when planning their game strategy. Knowing the team gains confidence to hit homeruns when they are scoring walks, they can aim to increase their number of walks scored each game. Scoring more homeruns will lead to the teams higher odds of success and therefore answering our final Question 3 that there is in fact a correlation.
## Discussion & Summary

###Summary
This article although does not align specifically to my three questions, discusses how the use of analytics in baseball is changing the game. It specifically highlights how analytics are used to identify stars, predict their performance, and weigh how much players are worth spending on financially. They can also use analytical tools to analyze pitching, hitting, and overall develop a better game strategy. 
###Generative AI Questions & Answers (Chat GPT) NOTE : Questions 1 and 3 Chat responsed not enough data to answer specifically about the Eastern division teams, extra questions were inserted below.
- Question 1:How does game attendance affect the Red Sox’s success on the field?
- Response 1: Overall, while game attendance itself may not directly determine the Red Sox's success on the field, it can have indirect effects on factors such as revenue generation, player morale, home-field advantage, and financial flexibility, all of which can contribute to the team's overall competitiveness and success.
- Question 2: How do you think mlb teams can use analytics to have more winning seasons?
- Response 2: Teams can identify undervalued players who may have a significant impact on the team's performance, monitoring player fatigue, and injury risk, and evaluate prospects while tracking player progress and areas for improvement.
- Question 3: Is analytics used by mlb teams considered unethical or cheating
- Response 3: Analytics is widely accepted and embraced as a standard practice within the league. Analytics provide teams with valuable insights into player performance, game strategy, and various other aspects of baseball operations. However, concerns typically arise when discussing the methods used to acquire data and tampering with the integrity of the game.
###Takeaways
Despite lacking some specific feedback to my original three questions, I am confident in that my insights driven from my visualizations matched the responses from Chapt GPT. Using the article and generative AI to gain insights allowed me to see the direct impact analytics has on the game of baseball. Using my visualizations and the responses from Chat GPT, MLB teams and the Red Sox's specifically show a large potential thrive financially with both their marketing efforts and changing the way they both coach players and approach the game itself.
