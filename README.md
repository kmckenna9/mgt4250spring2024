# MGT4250 Spring 2024 Course Project
Author: Kailey McKenna, kmckenna9@elon.edu
## Project Description
This repository is for the course project of MGT 4250 at Elon University.The purpose of this project was to provide questions and analytical insights to data of our choosing. I chose to look into the MLB franchise and specifically into the Boston Red Sox.
### Questions of interest
- Question 1 : What ballpark location in the MLB East division has had the largest amounts of total home wins?
- Question 2 :  How does game attendance affect the Red Sox’s success on the field?
- Question 3: Is there a relationship between walks scored and homeruns scored within Eastern division teams?
### Importance
- This is *especially* **important** because...
 1. Reason: Marketing efforts can be increased geographically through billboards and radio shows as well as coupons in local grocery stores once analysts know what locations are bringing in the most and least number of fans.
 2. Reason: Having this information about how attendance affects team success, marketers can focus on increasing their efforts for big games to increase the odds of winning.
 3. Reason: Seeing how walks correlates to homeruns can help mlb teams and coaches increase their odds of winning with a different approach to the game.
